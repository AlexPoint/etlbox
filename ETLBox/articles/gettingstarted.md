# Getting started

ETLBox is split into two main components: Control Flow Tasks and Data Flow Tasks.

## Control flow tasks

You should start to get aquainted with the Control Flow tasks. A good starting point is the [Example Control Flow](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox/wiki/Example-Control-Flow)

Control Flow task can be split in "General" task - it is a comprehensive set of task to manage, alter or query a database. See [General Control Flow Tasks](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox/wiki/General-Control-Flow-Tasks) for a full overview of all tasks

All taks come with the ability to produce log. There are some special task that enables you to create or query the log tables easily. See [Logging Control Flow Tasks](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox/wiki/Logging-Control-Flow-Tasks) for more details. 

## Data flow 

Another feature of the etlbox library is to create your own data flow pipeline. See the [Example Data Flow](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox/wiki/Example-Data-Flow) to get started. All pipeline elements are shown in 
 [Data Flow Tasks](https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox/wiki/Data-Flow-Tasks)
